This program simulates digital circuits.
please be careful when you want to inter your input please enter like the sample I write :
for example I wnat to inter circuit like picture (sample.png)
4 //I have four gates
and 1 //first type of gates then ID
and 2
or 3
not 4
1 2  (start gates)//enter starter gate and write (start gates)
4 (end gate)//enter end gate and write (end gate)
// plan
3 1 2 //for example I want to put result of gates 1 and 2 in gate 3 , first write final gate then writes gates you want to put as result
4 3 // not need one input 
0111 // enter input you want to put in starter gates in order of starter gates you inter
